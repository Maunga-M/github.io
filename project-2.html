						<h1>What Venture Capital Gets Wrong About AI Scaling</h1>

						<p>
							Venture capital matured in an era when the growth of software
							companies followed a reassuring pattern. A firm would spend
							heavily to develop a product and bring it to market, but once the
							work was done the cost of serving each additional customer was
							relatively small. As sales increased, the margins improved. Over
							time, this pattern hardened into expectation and investors came to
							assume that scale would steadily reduce the relative weight of
							costs.
						</p>

						<p>
							Artificial intelligence does not always behave in this way. Many
							AI systems, particularly those deployed in finance, healthcare, or
							other regulated fields, remain costly long after their initial
							release. Each new customer adds to the demand for computing power,
							infrastructure and technical oversight. Models must be observed
							carefully to ensure that their outputs remain consistent and
							defensible, especially where errors may expose clients to legal or
							reputational harm. And as data evolves, performance can drift,
							which in turn requires retraining, recalibration and further
							supervision.
						</p>

						<p>
							The result is that growth does not necessarily lighten the
							enterprise. In some AI businesses, rising usage brings rising
							operating expense. Revenue expands, but so does the infrastructure
							required to sustain it. The company becomes larger and more
							complex at the same time. This creates an awkward tension when
							such firms are evaluated using venture benchmarks designed for an
							earlier generation of software companies. Rapid revenue growth is
							ordinarily treated as a signal that efficiency will soon follow.
							In many AI ventures, however, increasing revenue reflects heavier
							computational demand and expanding layers of oversight. A startup
							may appear to be thriving commercially while struggling to deliver
							the widening margins investors have been trained to expect.
						</p>

						<p>
							Strategic behaviour then adjusts accordingly. Founders feel
							pressure to emphasise autonomy and automation even when prudent
							deployment requires caution and human review. Investors, for their
							part, may interpret operational discipline as a lack of ambition
							rather than as an acknowledgment of structural cost. Neither side
							is irrational. Both are simply operating within expectations
							shaped by a different technological era.
						</p>

						<p>
							Not all AI businesses face this constraint. Some consumer tools
							and lower-risk applications may scale in ways that resemble
							traditional software. But many of the most consequential uses of
							AI are embedded within existing institutions, where reliability
							and accountability revolve around the product itself. In such
							settings, oversight is not a temporary burden but a permanent
							feature of the business model.
						</p>

						<p>
							The difficulty, then, is not that AI lacks transformative
							potential. It is that much of it operates under an economic logic
							that differs from the one venture capital was built to fund.
							Investors learned to reward companies that grew lighter as they
							expanded but many AI firms grow heavier. Until those expectations
							adjust, the mismatch will persist.
