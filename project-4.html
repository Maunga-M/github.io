						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>
							This dashboard is built from a multi-year supply chain dataset
							covering commercial activity across several markets from January
							2015 to January 2018. The data tracks each order in detail,
							including financial results and fulfillment performance. This
							makes it possible to analyze profitability together with
							operational execution and provides a complete view of overall
							business performance.
						</p>
						<p class="redirect">
							The dataset used in this project can be accessed on Mendeley Data:
							<a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/3">
								https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/3
							</a>
						</p>

						<section class="project-image">
							<img src="assets/img/project-4/Dashboard.svg" alt="" />
						</section>
						<p>
							The dashboard is arranged to answer three escalating questions:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>How is profitability moving?</li>
							<li>Where is it concentrated?</li>
							<li>Are business operations influencing the result?</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div id="profitability" class="project-section">
						<h2>Profitability Trends</h2>
						<p>
							To analyse trends, I grouped daily transactions into monthly
							totals to reduce short-term fluctuations and make longer-term
							patterns clearer. I created separate line charts for Revenue,
							Profit, and Units Sold so each metric could be viewed clearly
							without scale issues.
						</p>

						<p>
							The measures (Total Profit, Total Revenue and Units Sold) were
							built to ensure consistent aggregation logic and reliable
							interaction with filters and date selections
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="project-section">
						<h3>Key Findings</h3>
						<section class="project-image">
							<img src="assets/img/project-4/trends.svg" alt="" />
						</section>
						<p>
							Revenue, profit, and units sold move closely together for most of
							the period. This suggests that profit margins remained relatively
							stable and that changes in performance were largely driven by
							sales volume rather than pricing or cost shifts.
						</p>

						<p>
							In late 2017, all three metrics fall sharply and stay at lower
							levels. Because revenue and profit continue to move in line with
							each other, the decline appears to be linked to reduced sales
							activity rather than a change in profitability per unit. The drop
							is sudden rather than gradual, which indicates a clear shift in
							performance during that period.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="geographic-concentration" class="project-section">
						<h2>Geographic and Portfolio Structure</h2>
						<p>
							To examine geographic concentration, I used a field parameter that
							allow switching between Market, Region, and Country views. An
							additional parameter allows the metric to change between Revenue
							and Profit to make comparisons straightforward within the same
							visual.
						</p>

						<p>
							Ranking was handled using RANKX together with a Top-N selector, to
							allow users to view either the Top 5 or Top 10 entities within any
							selected geographic scope. This reduced the need for multiple
							charts while keeping the analysis flexible and interactive.
						</p>

						<p>
							Customer segment contribution was shown through a profit
							distribution pie chart, while product-level concentration was
							analysed using a ranked bar chart displaying the Top 5 categories
							by total profit.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="project-section">
						<h3>Key Findings</h3>
						<section class="project-image">
							<img src="assets/img/project-4/geography.svg" alt="" />
						</section>
						<p>
							At the country level, the United States generates the highest
							share of profit, showing clear concentration in a single market.
							However, when results are grouped by broader categories, Europe
							ranks as the top region and market overall. This means that while
							one country leads individually, Europe contributes more when
							viewed as a combined region.
						</p>

						<p>
							The structure therefore shows concentration at the country level
							and broader distribution at the regional level. Performance
							depends heavily on the United States, but Europe provides
							collective strength across multiple countries. This balance
							reduces some risk, although results remain sensitive to changes in
							the leading country.
						</p>

						<section class="project-image">
							<img src="assets/img/project-4/segments.svg" alt="" />
						</section>
						<p>
							The Consumer segment accounts for more than half of total profit,
							with Corporate contributing a smaller share and Home Office the
							least. This shows that overall performance is largely driven by
							consumer demand, with limited balance across segments.
						</p>

						<p>
							At the product level, Fishing generates the highest profit,
							followed by Cleats and Camping & Hiking. The gap between these
							leading categories and the rest suggests that profitability is
							concentrated in a small number of product lines rather than spread
							evenly across the portfolio.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="operations" class="project-section">
						<h2>Business Operations</h2>
						<p>
							To assess operational performance, I analysed Order Status as a
							percentage of total orders. This ensured results remain comparable
							across different filters and helps show how orders progress
							through the fulfillment process.
						</p>

						<p>
							Shipping performance was evaluated using Total Orders, Average
							Profit per Order, and Average Shipping Days. This made it possible
							to compare delivery speed, profitability, and order volume across
							shipping modes within the same view.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="project-section">
						<section class="project-image">
							<img src="assets/img/project-4/operations.svg" alt="" />
						</section>
						<h3>Key Findings</h3>
						<p>
							Completed orders make up the largest share of total orders, while
							a noticeable portion remains in processing and pending stages.
							This suggests that revenue depends on how efficiently orders move
							through the system because delays can affect when sales are
							finalized and cash is received.
						</p>

						<p>
							Shipping times follow the expected pattern, with Same Day being
							the fastest and Standard Class the slowest. However, profit per
							order does not increase significantly with faster delivery. Most
							orders are placed under Standard Class, which could mean that
							overall shipping profitability is driven more by volume than by
							premium delivery options.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="modeling-notes" class="project-section">
						<h2>Modelling Reference</h2>
						<p>
							The multi-year dataset was imported into Power BI Desktop and each
							column was reviewed for relevance to the analysis. Fields that
							were not required were removed to keep the model focused and
							efficient.
						</p>

						<p>
							Column names were cleaned for clarity and inconsistencies were
							checked before loading the data into the model. The measures
							created for the dashboard are listed below.

						<h2>Author's Note</h2>
						<p>
							I undertook this power BI project as an opportunity to combine
							analytical thinking with visual design. I enjoy working with data
							and graphics, so this project allowed me to translate raw
							information into an interactive dashboard. Building the model
							required careful data preparation and deliberate visual design
							choices. It definitely improved my understanding of how modelling
							decisions affect interpretation, and also how clarity in
							presentation improves analytical communication.
