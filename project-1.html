							Airtel Networks Zambia Plc is one of Zambia’s major
							telecommunications operators and has a customer base of over 11
							million. The company provides mobile voice, data, and mobile
							financial services to both retail and corporate clients. It
							operates as part of the Airtel Africa Group and has been listed on
							the Lusaka Securities Exchange since 2008.
						</p>

						<p>
							This project presents a financial statement analysis of Airtel
							Zambia based on its 2024 annual report. It's purpose is to
							evaluate the company’s financial performance using information
							from the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.
							The analysis interprets the reported figures to provide a clear
							view of Airtel Zambia’s financial position and performance during
							the 2024 financial year.

					<!-- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
					<section id="executive-summary" class="project-section">
						<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
						<p>
							In 2024, Airtel Zambia recorded revenue growth of 26%, supported
							by continued expansion of its customer base and network
							infrastructure. Profit after tax increased by 10%, confirming that
							the company remains strongly profitable. However, both operating
							and net profit margins declined slightly due to higher network
							costs, increased depreciation, rising finance expenses, and
							foreign exchange losses.
						</p>

						<p>
							Liquidity remains constrained, as reflected in the low current
							ratio and the net current liability position. This aligns with the
							company’s prepaid business model, which generates strong operating
							cash flows and results in a negative operating cycle. Cash
							generation therefore remains solid.
						</p>

						<p>
							Leverage is still elevated, although net debt declined during the
							year. Higher finance costs and weaker interest cover point to
							increased exposure to interest rate and currency risk. The
							company's operational efficiency improved meaningfully in 2024,
							with infrastructure investments being utilised more effectively
							and working capital tightly managed. Dividend payouts remain high
							relative to earnings, although total dividends recognised during
							the year declined compared to 2023.
						</p>

						<p>
							Overall, the company is profitable and generates strong cash
							flows, but its high leverage and margin pressure mean that
							continued earnings stability is essential to maintain financial
							strength.
						</p>
					</section>

					<!-- PROFITABILITY -->
					<section id="profitability" class="project-section">
						<h2>Profitability</h2>
						<p>
							Airtel Zambia delivered strong top-line growth in 2024, with
							revenue rising 26% from K5.6 billion to K7.1 billion. However,
							profit after tax increased by a more modest 10%, from K1.1 billion
							to K1.25 billion. This gap between revenue growth and profit
							growth indicates that additional sales were generated at thinner
							margins.
						</p>

						<p>
							Operating profit increased from K2,276 million to K2,637 million.
							However, the operating margin declined from approximately 40% in
							2023 to 37% in 2024. Since operating profit is generated from
							revenue less operating expenses (including network costs, sales
							and marketing, licence fees, and depreciation), this decline in
							margin indicates that operating costs have increased at a faster
							rate than revenue.
						</p>

						<p>
							At the financing level, profit before tax increased to K1.95
							billion. However, finance costs rose sharply from K429 million to
							K551 million, and foreign exchange losses almost doubled to K138
							million. These higher financing and currency costs absorbed a
							significant portion of the additional operating profit.As a
							result, the net profit margin declined from 20% to 18%. The
							business remains highly profitable, but the efficiency of
							converting revenue into final earnings has weakened slightly.
						</p>

						<p>
							Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) improved significantly from
							58.5% to 74.3%, driven by higher operating profit and a reduction
							in net debt.<sup>[1]</sup> This indicates that the capital
							invested in the business is being used more intensively. Return on
							Equity (ROE), on the other hand, declined from 259% to 222%.<sup
								>[2]</sup
							>
							Although profits increased, the growth in equity diluted the
							overall return percentage. Even so, ROE remains exceptionally high
							and reflects the company’s leveraged capital structure
						</p>

						<p>
							With finance costs of K551 million on borrowings of about K3.1
							billion, the effective finance cost rate (including lease
							interest) is approximately 17–18%.<sup>[3]</sup> Given that ROCE
							stands at 74.3%, the company continues to generate returns well
							above its borrowing cost, creating economic value despite rising
							finance expenses.
						</p>

						<p>
							Overall, Airtel achieved strong revenue growth in 2024, but this
							growth came with margin pressure and higher financing risk. The
							company remains profitable and cash-generative, but sustaining
							this performance will require careful control of operating and
							financing costs going forward.
						</p>
					</section>

					<!-- LIQUIDITY -->
					<section id="liquidity" class="project-section">
						<h2>Liquidity</h2>
						<p>
							Despite strong profitability, Airtel Zambia’s balance sheet shows
							ongoing short-term liquidity pressure. At 31 December 2024,
							current assets stood at approximately K1 billion, while current
							liabilities totalled about K3.9 billion. This results in a current
							ratio of 0.26:1, down from 0.32:1 in 2023.<sup>[4]</sup> On the
							surface, this suggests that short-term obligations significantly
							exceed short-term assets. The company also reported a net current
							liability position of roughly K2.9 billion, compared to K2 billion
							in the prior year.<sup>[5]</sup> This indicates that short-term
							liabilities increased at a faster rate than short-term assets
							during 2024.
						</p>

						<p>
							However, these figures must be interpreted within the context of
							Airtel’s operating model. The company operates largely on a
							prepaid basis, meaning cash is often received before services are
							delivered. This leads to contract liabilities rather than trade
							receivables and results in a structurally low current ratio. In
							effect, the business collects cash upfront and recognises revenue
							later. Operating cash flow during the year was strong at
							approximately K3.1 billion, comfortably exceeding reported profit.
							This confirms effective cash conversion and supports the view that
							liquidity risk is operationally manageable despite the weak
							current ratio.
						</p>

						<p>
							Trade and other receivables total approximately K414.7 million, of
							which K371.4 million relates to related-party balances. Net trade
							receivables are only about K43.4 million.Receivables represent
							only a small fraction of annual turnover, reflecting tight credit
							control and limited exposure to bad debts, consistent with the
							prepaid model.
						</p>

						<p>
							The main liquidity pressure arises from short-term borrowings.
							Current maturities of loans and overdrafts amount to approximately
							K1.9 billion. This means the company depends heavily on
							refinancing and rollover of facilities. While management reports
							access to committed funding lines, this reliance introduces
							refinancing risk, particularly in a high interest rate
							environment.
						</p>

						<p>
							It is also notable that dividends continue to be distributed
							despite the net current liability position. Although the business
							generates strong cash flows, ongoing dividend payments limit
							balance sheet strengthening and maintain reliance on external
							financing.
						</p>
					</section>

					<!-- LEVERAGE -->
					<section id="leverage" class="project-section">
						<h2>Leverage</h2>

						<p>
							At 31 December 2024, total borrowings, including overdrafts and
							lease liabilities, amounted to approximately K3.1 billion, down
							from K3.5 billion in 2023. Cash balances increased to about K145
							million from K81 million. After deducting cash, net debt declined
							from roughly K3.45 billion to K3 billion. This reduction of about
							K460 million shows that the company reduced leverage during the
							year.
						</p>

						<p>
							Total capital (equity plus net debt) stood at approximately K3.55
							billion in 2024, compared to K3.89 billion in 2023. On this basis,
							the gearing ratio declined from 89% to 84%.<sup>[6]</sup> Although
							leverage remains high, the downward movement is positive. Equity
							remains relatively small at about K564 million compared to
							borrowings of over K3.1 billion. This means the business continues
							to rely heavily on debt financing. As a result, changes in
							interest rates, exchange rates, or profitability could have a
							significant impact on shareholder returns.
						</p>

						<p>
							Interest cover declined from 5.3x to 4.8x.<sup>[7]</sup> The
							company still generates enough operating profit to meet its
							interest obligations comfortably. However, the decline reflects
							higher finance costs and reduces the margin of safety. If
							borrowing costs rise further, coverage could weaken.
						</p>

						<p>
							Despite high leverage, current solvency appears manageable.
							Operating cash flow exceeded K3 billion during the year, net debt
							declined, and interest is covered nearly five times by operating
							profit. There were no reported breaches of loan covenants.
						</p>

						<p>
							However, the capital structure carries ongoing risks. The company
							is exposed to interest rate movements on floating-rate debt,
							foreign exchange risk on USD-denominated borrowings, and
							refinancing risk due to large short-term maturities.
						</p>

						<p>
							The company's capital structure is sustainable under current
							conditions, supported by strong cash generation. However, the high
							reliance on debt means that stability depends on continued
							earnings growth, controlled finance costs, and stable
							macroeconomic conditions.
						</p>
					</section>

					<!-- EFFICIENCY -->
					<section id="efficiency" class="project-section">
						<h2>Efficiency</h2>

						<p>
							The resources of a business are used to generate revenue and
							profit, and the efficiency with which those resources are deployed
							directly influences returns to investors. Efficiency ratios show
							how effectively Airtel Zambia uses its assets to generate revenue
							and manage working capital. These indicators help explain the
							movement in return on capital and cash generation during the year
						</p>

						<p>
							Asset turnover increased from 1.02x in 2023 to 1.26x in 2024.<sup
								>[8]</sup
							>
							This means the company generated more revenue per kwacha invested
							in assets. The improvement is significant and indicates better
							utilisation of infrastructure and network assets. Although
							operating margins declined slightly, the stronger asset turnover
							more than offset this effect and contributed to the improvement in
							return on capital. In practical terms, investments made in prior
							years are now generating higher revenue.
						</p>

						<p>
							Non-current assets account for approximately 82% of total assets,
							confirming that the business is highly capital intensive. The
							company relies heavily on network equipment, spectrum licences,
							and right-of-use assets to operate. Depreciation and amortisation
							totalled approximately K881 million and was equal to about 12% of
							revenue.<sup>[9]</sup> This highlights the ongoing reinvestment
							requirement in the telecommunications sector. Sustained growth
							depends not only on revenue expansion but also on continued
							capital expenditure to maintain and expand the network.
						</p>

						<p>
							Inventory remains minimal relative to revenue. Inventory days
							declined from 2.2 days to 1.1 days.<sup>[10]</sup> This is
							consistent with a service-based model where physical inventory
							plays a limited role. Lower inventory days reduce holding costs
							and minimise the risk of obsolescence. Given the nature of the
							industry, inventory management is not a major driver of
							performance.
						</p>

						<p>
							Receivables days declined from 4.9 days to 2.2 days.<sup
								>[11]</sup
							>
							This reflects the predominantly prepaid model and strong credit
							control. Cash is collected quickly, which supports operating cash
							flow and reduces reliance on external financing. The improvement
							reinforces earlier observations that earnings are efficiently
							converted into cash.
						</p>

						<p>
							Payables days increased slightly from 77 days to 80 days, which
							means the company is taking slightly longer to pay suppliers.<sup
								>[12]</sup
							>
							A moderate extension of payment terms can provide short-term
							financing support without signalling financial difficulty. The
							increase appears controlled and contributes positively to working
							capital management.
						</p>

						<p>
							The operating cycle remains strongly negative at approximately –77
							days, compared to –70 days in 2023.<sup>[13]</sup> A negative
							cycle means the company receives cash from customers before paying
							suppliers. In practice, customers pay upfront for services through
							prepaid airtime and data, while supplier payments are settled
							later. As a result, the business does not need to finance working
							capital from its own cash or bank borrowings. This structural
							feature of the prepaid model supports liquidity, even though
							short-term liabilities exceed short-term assets.
						</p>
					</section>

					<!-- INVESTOR RATIOS -->
					<section id="investor-ratios" class="project-section">
						<h2>Investor Ratios</h2>
						<p>
							Airtel Zambia distributed most of its earnings to shareholders in
							2024, continuing its high payout policy. Earnings per share (EPS)
							increased from K10.95 in 2023 to K12.04 in 2024, reflecting the
							10% growth in profit after tax.<sup>[14]</sup> As no new shares
							were issued, this increase was not diluted. Shareholders therefore
							benefited directly from higher earnings during the year.
						</p>

						<p>
							Dividend per share (DPS) for 2024 is approximately K10.84, based
							on total dividends of K1.13 billion recognised during the year.
							This is lower than the K1.37 billion distributed in 2023.<sup
								>[15]</sup
							>
							Although earnings increased, total dividends recognised during
							2024 declined, resulting in a modest improvement in dividend
							cover.
						</p>

						<p>
							Dividend cover improved to approximately 1.11x from below 1x in
							2023.<sup>[16]</sup> While this represents an improvement, the
							cover ratio remains low. Earnings only modestly exceed dividend
							distributions, leaving limited retained profit to reduce debt or
							strengthen equity. In a capital-intensive and highly leveraged
							business, such a low cover ratio constrains financial flexibility.
							Dividend sustainability therefore depends on continued stable
							earnings and strong cash generation.
						</p>
					</section>

					<!-- CONCLUSION -->
					<section id="overall-conclusion" class="project-section">
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>
							Airtel Zambia remains a financially strong business, supported by
							robust cash generation and improving asset utilisation. The
							company continues to earn returns well above its cost of debt,
							which indicates that value is being created despite margin
							pressure.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, the capital structure remains highly leveraged, and the
							near-100% dividend payout leaves limited retained earnings to
							strengthen the balance sheet. Financial resilience therefore
							depends on continued earnings stability and controlled financing
							costs. Exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk remains
							a key consideration.
						</p>

						<p>
							For potential investors, the company offers strong current
							earnings and an attractive dividend stream. However, this return
							profile is accompanied by elevated financial risk due to leverage
							and limited dividend cover. The investment case therefore reflects
							a balance between strong cash generation and sensitivity to
							macroeconomic conditions.
						</p>

						<p>
							Overall, the company’s performance in 2024 demonstrates
							operational strength, but its capital structure requires
							disciplined management to preserve long-term resilience.
