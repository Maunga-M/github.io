							For several years, South Africa experienced what was widely
							characterised as state capture. The name “Gupta” moved from
							business reporting to the centre of national political debate.
							Companies linked to the Gupta family secured state contracts and
							channelled billions of rands through the formal banking system. By
							the time law enforcement began to respond meaningfully, key actors
							had already left the jurisdiction. The scandal continues to raise
							difficult questions about whether modern financial oversight
							systems can withstand sustained political influence.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="influence" class="project-section">
						<h2>From Enterprise to Influence</h2>
						<p>
							Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta arrived in South Africa from India in
							the 1990s and established business interests across media, mining,
							technology and engineering. By the mid-2000s and into the 2010s,
							companies linked to the family were securing substantial contracts
							with South African state-owned enterprises, including Eskom, the
							national power utility, and Transnet, the freight and logistics
							company responsible for transporting coal, iron ore and
							containerised goods across the country.
						</p>
						<p>
							Through Oakbay Investments and a network of affiliated entities,
							the family cultivated close relationships with senior political
							office holders, most notably President Jacob Zuma. Over time,
							investigative reporting and the findings of the Judicial
							Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture (the Zondo
							Commission) concluded that these relationships extended beyond
							conventional political patronage. They involved systematic efforts
							to influence public appointments, procurement outcomes and
							redirect public resources for private benefit.
						</p>
						<p>
							State contracts worth billions were alleged to have flowed through
							Gupta-linked entities and, in many instances, through layered
							offshore structures. Importantly, much of this money moved through
							regulated banks within South Africa’s formal financial system,
							rather than outside it.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="banks" class="project-section">
						<h2>The Banks Cut Ties</h2>
						<p>
							South Africa does not lack financial sophistication. Its banking
							sector is widely regarded as one of the most developed and
							well-regulated on the African continent. It also operates within a
							comprehensive anti-money-laundering framework aligned with
							international standards. Financial institutions are legally
							obliged to verify clients, identify politically exposed persons
							and submit suspicious transaction reports where appropriate. The
							system is designed to detect irregular financial movement within
							the formal economy. In the case of companies within the Gupta
							business network, those obligations were triggered repeatedly.
						</p>
						<p>
							Between December 2012 and June 2016, banks submitted seventy-two
							suspicious transaction reports relating to Gupta-linked entities.
							The scale of those reported transactions only became clearer
							later, during court filings in October 2016, which revealed that a
							certificate issued by the Financial Intelligence Centre indicated
							that the transactions in question amounted to approximately R6.8
							billion. Although the reports had been submitted over several
							years, there is no public record of successful criminal
							prosecution or asset forfeiture during that period in relation to
							those specific transactions.
						</p>
						<p>
							During this same period, several institutions reassessed their
							exposure. In November 2014, Absa’s politically exposed persons
							committee resolved to terminate its relationship with Oakbay
							Investments, the Gupta family’s principal holding company, citing
							unexplained transfers and escalating risk. Formal closures
							followed in December 2015 and early 2016. Nedbank and FNB issued
							notice in April 2016 and terminated services shortly thereafter.
							Standard Bank, after filing suspicious transaction reports,
							notified Oakbay that it would also end its relationship.
						</p>
						<p>
							These were commercial risk decisions taken by the banks
							themselves. Public records do not indicate that the closures were
							mandated by regulatory enforcement at that stage. When the
							decisions became public, Cabinet established an inter-ministerial
							committee to examine them and ministers met with financial
							institutions. The banks did not reverse their decisions, and the
							courts later confirmed that government lacked the authority to
							compel private institutions to maintain banking relationships.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="adaption" class="project-section">
						<h2>Adaptation and Collapse</h2>
						<p>
							The withdrawal of the major domestic banks did not immediately
							halt the movement of funds. Instead, Gupta-linked entities
							consolidated their banking activities through the South African
							branch of Bank of Baroda, which allowed the network’s financial
							operations to continue despite mounting criticism.
						</p>

						<p>
							A key illustration of this shift involved business deals with the
							national power utility Eskom. In April 2016, Eskom's board
							approved a prepayment of over R600 million to the mining company
							Tegeta, which was controlled by the Gupta family, for future coal
							deliveries to the Majuba power station. Evidence later presented
							to the Zondo Commission indicated that this prepayment formed part
							of the funding structure that enabled Tegeta to complete its
							acquisition of Optimum Coal Mine. Money from this deal flowed into
							the Gupta's Baroda accounts. According to the Organised Crime and
							Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), Eskom transferred more than
							R1.8 billion into multiple accounts belonging to the Gupta family
							at Bank of Baroda between January 2016 and February 2017, .
						</p>

						<p>
							Regulatory inspections later identified compliance deficiencies at
							Bank of Baroda’s South African branch under the Financial
							Intelligence Centre Act, including failures relating to customer
							due diligence and reporting obligations. In 2017, the South
							African Reserve Bank imposed an administrative penalty of R11
							million, which was significantly reduced to R400,000 on appeal.
							Later that year, the bank announced that it would close
							Gupta-linked accounts and withdraw its operations from South
							Africa.
						</p>

						<p>
							In February 2018, President Jacob Zuma resigned amid mounting
							political and legal pressure linked to the state-capture
							allegations. Shortly thereafter, the Gupta brothers fled to Dubai.
							Their exit coincided with intensifying investigations and a
							political climate that had become less protective of their
							network. In June 2022, the Gupta brothers were arrested in the
							United Arab Emirates pursuant to Interpol red notices linked to
							South African charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering.
							South Africa’s subsequent extradition request for Atul and Rajesh
							Gupta was dismissed by a UAE court in early 2023, which held that
							jurisdictional and procedural requirements had not been satisfied.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="regulation" class="project-section">
						<h2>Regulating the Politically Connected</h2>
						<p>
							The international pursuit of the Gupta brothers addressed only one
							dimension of the problem. The broader challenge lay in how
							government institutions managed the intersection of political
							power and commercial activity, particularly in relation to
							financial crime. The controversy surrounding the bank closures in
							2016 revealed a deeper tension within the anti-money-laundering
							framework. The issue was not only whether suspicious transactions
							had been reported, but how financial institutions were expected to
							treat clients whose influence derived from proximity to political
							power.
						</p>
						<p>
							Rules governing politically exposed persons exist because power
							attracts illicit capital. When an individual holds prominent
							public office, the risk of corruption increases and enhanced
							safeguards are meant to follow. The Gupta network’s advantage did
							not arise primarily from technical loopholes or weak controls, but
							from its close association with political authority. Its
							businesses operated alongside senior office holders, most notably
							President Jacob Zuma, whose administration oversaw the state-owned
							enterprises that awarded lucrative contracts to Gupta-linked
							companies.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anti-money laundering frameworks in many jurisdictions distinguish
							between foreign and domestic political exposure. Foreign
							politically exposed persons are typically treated as inherently
							higher risk and are automatically subject to enhanced due
							diligence measures, including senior management approval,
							source-of-wealth verification and intensified ongoing monitoring.
							Domestic politically exposed persons, by contrast, are often
							assessed under a risk-based approach rather than being categorised
							as high risk by default. Financial institutions are required to
							evaluate the specific circumstances of the relationship and
							determine whether enhanced monitoring is warranted based on their
							own assessment of risk. In principle, this distinction reflects
							ideas of sovereignty and proportionality. Foreign exposure carries
							cross-border corruption risks that are presumed higher, while
							domestic exposure is evaluated within the context of local
							oversight systems. In practice, however, applying a discretionary
							approach to powerful domestic actors or those closely associated
							with them can create structural challenges that do not arise in
							ordinary commercial relationships.
						</p>

						<p>
							First, there is an asymmetry of power. Senior political figures
							and their associates often possess access to legal expertise,
							advisory networks and complex corporate structures that distance
							them from the proceeds of questionable transactions. Funds may
							move through layered entities or offshore arrangements that are
							lawful on paper but difficult to keep track of. Establishing
							criminal intent in such circumstances requires sustained
							investigative capacity and institutional stability. Second,
							enforcement decisions carry consequences. Escalating monitoring or
							pursuing action against politically connected individuals may
							trigger institutional resistance or political backlash. The
							reaction of cabinet ministers to the 2016 bank closures
							demonstrated how compliance decisions involving state-linked
							clients could quickly escalate beyond internal risk processes and
							into political confrontation.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Gupta case demonstrates that technical reporting mechanisms
							can function while decisive enforcement against politically
							connected networks remains difficult to sustain. These dynamics do
							not imply that anti-money-laundering systems are inherently
							ineffective or doomed to fail in political cases. They illustrate
							that such systems depend on independence and insulation from
							political pressure. Where those conditions are fragile, the
							application of rules to powerful insiders becomes uneven.

						<h2>Author's Note</h2>
						<p>
							I carried this case study to better understand the gap that can
							emerge between regulation and enforcement in practice. The Gupta
							state capture was one of the most consequential governance scandals in
							South Africa’s recent history, and its scale made for an even more
							interesting study. It offered very good example of how political
							proximity can test even strong financial systems. Through this
							analysis, I developed a deeper appreciation for the structural
							challenges faced by institutions tasked with applying
							anti-money-laundering controls to politically connected actors.
